    abstract = {The China sustainable development is the simultaneously three key facets, including urbanism, industrialization, and information. Building a Smart Low-carbon City is an energy strategy for the sustainable development of Chinese cities. One technology way for this strategy is the City Intelligent Energy Network ({CIEN}), supporting a green, ecological development of the Chinese cities. {CIEN} starts from the redistribute of city land-use, taking small gas turbine as the major power, combining with the new energy mode, such as solar energy, wind energy and low level energy (geothermal, ice cold storage, water cold storage). {CIEN} could supply relatively large network and grid with electricity, heat, and cold, realizing the efficient, integrate and gradable use of the energy network technology. As {CIEN} is on its starting point, so this kind of technology still need the combination work with the lab research and applicable field test. Considering the city unit scale, the transportation mode, energy resources, and the traditional mode to power grid and other factors, the key point is to balance the economical use and the resource capability and adaptability. This paper tries to use the 2007 statistical data including city economy, construction, population, and different energy parameter, to establish the comprehensive model. Combining the model results, the {CIEN} adaptability will be discussed, and meaningful policies will be proposed, with the focusing of how to build a Smart Low-carbon city. ©© 22001144 {TPuhbelAishuethdobrsy}. {EPlusbevliisehreBd}.{bVy}. {EOlpseenvaieccreBss}.Vun.der {CC} {BY}-{NC}-{ND} license. {SSeelleeccttiioonn} aanndd {pPeeeerr}--rreevviieeww uunnddeerr {rreessppoonnssiibbiilliittyyoofftEhelhPardoigMra}.{mShCahkasihrsu}.ki.},

The proposed methods involves analytical model and stochastic user equilibrium model based on the prospect theory. Finally, by studying the different reliability conditions, the change in the value of prospect and the flow on routes were found, and a reliability sensitivity analysis was conducted.

For the case of the one-to-one {BSP} problem, we incorporate the classical bidirectional search scheme in the proposed algorithm to reduce the number of iterations in practice. The proposed algorithm also includes pruning strategies to avoid the computation of unnecessary labels. The result is a fast algorithm to solve the one-to-one {BSP} problem in large networks.

    abstract = {This paper proposes a multi-criteria user equilibrium model considering travel time, travel time reliability and distance ({MUE}-{TRD}). This new model hypothesizes that for each user class and each origin-destination (O-D) pair no traveler can reduce either his or her reliable travel time or travel distance or both without worsening the other objective by unilaterally changing routes in their route choice decision process. Travel time budget which consists of travel time and travel time reliability is used to describe the reliable travel time. A maximum entropy multi-criteria user equilibrium ({ME}-{MUE}) model is presented to address the non-uniqueness of the solution in {MUE}-{TRD} model. Furthermore, a route-based solution algorithm based on the partial linearization descent method (R-{PLD}) is developed to solve the {ME}-{MUE} model. Numerical examples are also provided to illustrate the essential ideas of the proposed model and the applicability of the developed solution algorithm. The results show that compared to traditional user equilibrium and travel time budget models, {ME}-{MUE} model is more consistent with the real trip process that the reliable travel time is increasing with the decreasing of travel distance in used routes; and the road trafﬁc is smoother when using {ME}-{MUE} model to design the road network, thus {ME}-{MUE} model can reduce road trafﬁc noise and air pollution in the urban road network.},

    abstract = {Understanding the employment status of passengers in public transit systems is significant for transport operators in many real applications such as forecasting travel demand and providing personalized transportation service. This paper develops a deep learning approach to infer a passenger's employment status by using smart card data ({SCD}) with a household survey. This paper first extracts an individual passenger's weekly travel patterns in different travel modes from the raw {SCD} as a threedimensional image. A deep learning architecture, called a thresholding multi-channel convolutional neural network, was developed to predict an individual's employment status. The approach proposed here solves two critical problems of using the {SCD} for employment status studies. First, it automatically incorporates learning temporal features in different travel modes without the need for handcrafted travel feature design. Second, it considers the class-imbalance problem by leveraging the ensemble of oversampling and thresholding techniques. By applying our approach to a real dataset collected from the metropolitan area of London, U.K., about 72\% of passengers were correctly categorized into six types of employment statuses. The promising results show the tight correlation between temporal travel behavior, mode choice, and social-demographic roles. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to infer employment status by using the {SCD}.},

    abstract = {Route selection is one of the most important problems for a car navigation system. Given a pair of origin and destination, there are many possible routes. Most current car navigation systems propose the shortest path from the origin to the destination. Selecting the shortest path is not a hard problem, but the shortest path is not always what the user wants; what the user really wants to have is the most comfortable route for him or her to drive. In other words, the driver wants to have a car navigation system to propose the subjectively optimal route for him or her. Finding such a route requires enumerating all the possible routes, and is known as a {NP}-complete problem. In order to reduce computational complexity, we employed a {GA} to find a (subjectively) quasi-optimal route for the driver. In the previous paper, we reported our attempt to integrate uncomfortable-turns to our {GA}-based route selection algorithm. Even though {GA} provided a quasi-optimal route in most cases and certainly much faster than exhaustive search, we have found that the classical Dijkstra algorithm can be used to find subjectively the most comfortable route by changing the data structure. In this paper, we show how the data structure that represents routes can be modified to assist Dijkstra’s algorithm to find subjectively optimal driving route. The numerical experiments demonstrate the feasibility of our route selection based on Dijkstra algorithm with extended data structure.},
